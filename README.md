# SudokuSolverGame
This is a simple program built with Python and Pygame which generates a sudoku game you can play.
The interesting feature is recursive back-tracking algorithm built into the game which can tell if the user places a wrong move or a successful one.
Using this algorithm the user can also "Give Up" and watch in real time as the algorithm visually showcase the steps it takes in order to solve the puzzle.

 
 
 Open the files in an IDE and click run on GUI.py or run it from IDLE or command line.
 When you run it will give you a solvable sudoku puzzle from a setlist which can be easily edited to include more puzzles or input certain sudoku which you want to solve.
 To input numbers, you can click on a square and input a temp number or press enter after to see if was a correct move or not using 1-9 number keys for inputs and ENTER to see if it was
 correct.
 To see the back-tracking algorithm in action or solve a sudoku puzzle you can hit SPACE_BAR in the game to run it.
