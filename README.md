# SudokuSolverGame
This is a simple Python program which generates a sudoku game you can play with the interesting feature being the back-tracking algorithm built into the game which can tell  if
 the user places a wrong move or a successful one.
 The sudoku puzzle can also be solved automatically by pressing space on your keyboard while in-game to watch the algorithm work and sort through the puzzle until landing on a 
 successful board.
 
 To run you will just need a python IDE and pygame installed.
 Open the files in an IDE and click run on GUI.py or run it from IDLE or command line.
 When you run it will give you a solvable sudoku puzzle from a setlist which can be easily edited to include more puzzles or input certain sudoku which you want to solve.
 To input numbers, you can click on a square and input a temp number or press enter after to see if was a correct move or not using 1-9 number keys for inputs and ENTER to see if it was
 correct.
 To see the back-tracking algorithm in action or solve a sudoku puzzle you can hit SPACE_BAR in the game to run it.
 
 To-Do list:
 integrate sudoku puzzle generation for endless gameplay.
 Ability to input a sudoku puzzle without changing code to easily solve puzzles you are stuck on.
